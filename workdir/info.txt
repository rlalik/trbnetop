everything that is automatically running in this container
was started by /workdir/start.sh
which first calls /conf/conf.sh
and then starts some user processes (e.g. dabc, Go4 ...)
in separate tmux tabs

you are in a tmux (terminal multiplexer)
do not panic! - you can manage the tabs (called "windows")
with the following shortcuts:

ctrl-b n    to switch to the next     window
ctrl-b p    to switch to the previous window
ctrl-b 0-9  to switch to the n-th window directly
ctrl-b c    to create new a window
ctrl-b ,    to rename current window
